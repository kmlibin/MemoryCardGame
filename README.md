# Memory Card Game
## Udemy React Course Project

This is a classic card memory game - find the two matching cards, and the cards will stay face up. If they don't match, they will flip back over. There is a counter at the bottom of the screen that tracks the amount of turns you've taken, and it resets when you shuffle the deck.

### Languages

React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, JSX

### Project Highlights

This project was designed so that students could get a better understanding of how basic React apps work. It did this via:

    1. Using useState and useEffect hooks
    2. Passing and recieving props
    3. Implementing basic JavaScript logic to evaluate if cards matched, and what to do if the cards did (or didn't) match
    4. Creating dynamic classNames to house matched cards


### What I learned / Challenges

I enjoyed this project because it allowed me to see how React Developers go about actually figuring out where to start when building a project. 
Lots of Codecademy projects throw you in to a half built project, which is fine, but as I've been learning I have noticed it is harder to get a holistic understanding of how to build and manipulate a project if half of it is written for you. I mean, when you look at a game, how do you know which bit to start with? Being able to see and hear how an experienced developer breaks down each element and get started was extremely helpful. 

As this was the first project I've done from the ground up, it definitely took me a bit of time to put all of the concepts together - however, I did notice that when I was unsure or stumbled, I understood the solution/concept that was offered. 

The useEffect hook caused me the most issue. I was able to (more or less) write the logic for comparing the two cards, but I didn't realize that I needed to house it in the useEffect hook. I had previously only really seen them used for data requests, so being able to understand other applications for the hook was helpful.
